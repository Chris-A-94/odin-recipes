# odin-recipes

This project is meant to test what I've learned so far of HTML.

The end project will be a bare HTML website with an index webpage that links to a few different food recipes. I'll update this as I make it.

Only one recipe to go, I'm honestly having fun. The two added recipes so far are my invention, and it feels kinda nice to get them out in the world, even if the world is a random github repository.

I finished the project. It looks bare as hell, but that only motivates me to learn CSS.
